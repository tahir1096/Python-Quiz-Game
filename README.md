## 🎮 How It Works

1. The game starts with a welcome message.
2. You are asked if you want to play.
3. The program asks **10 computer-related questions**.
4. Each correct answer gives you **1 point**.
5. At the end, you get:

   * Total Score
   * Percentage
   * Emoji feedback (☹ 😐 😍)
6. You can choose to **play again** without restarting the program.
